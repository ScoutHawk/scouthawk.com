## Overview

The primary goal of the SMW is to input a small amount of work each day, amplified
by cross-polination of networks. The main output is new signups on the newsletter.
The SMW is the outermost ring of the funnel.

## Tools

* Tweetbot (maybe not this, but something that does multi-account well)
* Buffer (will it handle multi-account?)

## Other networks to use

* Instagram (posting to twitter is fine)
* Facebook (separate FB from business as much as possible)

## Schedule of activities

* Every morning, browse various link sites for 15 min in a new window. Open tabs
for things that look interesting.
* Quickly skim, close, and buffer (to Twitter & LinkedIn) interesting / valuable content.

## Cross linking

* All social accounts point to @SctHwk
* Social accounts in email sig
