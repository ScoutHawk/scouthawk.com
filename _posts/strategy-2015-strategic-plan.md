# 2015 Strategic Plan

## Mission
Scout Hawk exists to grow organizations focused on driving human progress by pioneering new ways of understanding and influencing human behavior, designing the best products and experiences money can buy, and leading the industry in putting humans first.

## Vision
Scout Hawk’s vision is help realize a world in which technology supports and empowers the growth and well being of people from any social class in a useful, usable, and ~~beautiful~~ sexy way.

**1 year** (2016, age 31): 150k in revenue. Exercising, meditating, and learning for fun regularly. Kid on the way. Completion of the Scout Hawk product design education app, which will let me string together a series of blog posts into a coherent, linear educational course. Pair the launch of the app with a book launch? 50% of monthly revenue comes from productized sources. 1 app ready for beta launch.

**5 years** (2020, age 35): 1MM in revenue. By the start of 2020, I should have the revenue part of the business automated or staffed away. I should maintain a skeleton crew, only hiring people when it gives me more freedom. Begin seriously pursuing majority social good work. Really, truly home onto something in the world that needs fixing and begin laying plans.

**10 years** (2025, age 40): Get to 2.5MM in retirement savings. Don’t do a midlife crisis. Begin entertaining the possibility of a liquidity event. Understand that things will start to really go downhill, so ease into less time at work, more time being an eccentric and working on the social good projects. Begin searching for the home I want to retire at.

**20 years:** (2035, age 50): Don’t fully retire, but scale back any work that’s strenuous in order to do strenuous non-work things. Make your last few decades really *count*. Climb a mountain — a good one — after 50. Do another 30m Free Dive after 50. Invest in lots of great companies, and great teams. Be wildly, extravagantly, anonymously generous. Give as much hope to the hopeless as possible.

**30 years:** (2045, age 60): Settle into the home where I’ll live out the rest of my days. It should be an awesome place to watch the sun go down, somewhere by a beach or sea cliff, with no stairs so we can stay until the bitter end, and so that someday the Halbert-Israel clan will have a family home on a sea cliff somewhere like Big Sur. Time getting one last sheepdog who outlives us, since he’ll be able to handle our loss better than we his. Get serious about meditation. Track down the right teacher if that’s what it takes.

## Values
- Design Driven — Everything is designed, whether a product or a spreadsheet.
- Experimental — Everything is an experiment, everything is measured, everything is continually improved.
- Socially Responsible — Always opt to work with organizations that have the greatest social impact, even if the pay isn’t as good.
